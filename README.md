# Memory Game

This Memory Game, also called Concentration, is a web-based game where a player tests their memory against five pairs of cards to match the symbols on the faces by clicking and flipping the cards over. 
I chose this game because it offered a good level of challenge for a first solo project while also being overwhemlingly difficult.
